## Project Overview
SmartWatt is a system built to monitor electricity usage in real-time. It gathers data from IoT sensors and smart meters throughout a hospital to provide insights into energy consumption patterns. This data is processed and analyzed to help hospital administrators make informed decisions, address inefficiencies, and ultimately reduce electricity costs. The system allows users to view energy statistics, control devices, and receive notifications about potential energy savings or abnormal consumption.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track energy usage in different hospital areas instantly.
- **Data Analysis and Forecasting:** Identify patterns and forecast future consumption to help with budgeting and planning.
- **Device Control and Management:** Remotely control and manage hospital devices, optimizing energy use where possible.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Get alerts for high energy usage, abnormalities, or system issues.
- **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Accessible dashboards for different stakeholders including hospital staff, maintenance teams, and regulatory bodies.
